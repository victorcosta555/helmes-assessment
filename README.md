# # Helmes Assessment 

Create a single page application 

Use index.html as the basis 
NB! Index.html has deficiencies so use it only for data and understanding what needs to be present in front-end

Make it look as good as you can visually in a reasonable time

"Sectors" selectbox:
- Add all the entries from the "Sectors" selectbox to database
- Compose the "Sectors" selectbox using data from database

Perform the following activities after the "Save" button has been pressed: 
- Validate all input data (all fields are mandatory)
- Store all input data to database (Name, Sectors, Agree to terms)
- Refill the form using stored data
- Allow the editing of the data

## Run it using docker-compose

```
 # docker-compose up -d
```
 1- Access http://localhost:4200
